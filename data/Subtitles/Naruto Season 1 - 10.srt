1
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:10,749
<i>C'mon!</i>

2
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,722
<i>Running like a fugitive,</i>

3
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,925
<i>Being chased by something</i>

4
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,263
<i>Inside my heart is pounding</i>

5
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>My throat dry like it's withering</i>

6
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,803
<i>For no single one,</i>

7
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:39,578
<i>To none does belong,</i>

8
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:45,317
<i>This time is ours, right now...</i>

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,823
<i>Unraveling the pain,</i>

10
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,655
<i>Unraveling our hearts,</i>

11
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:54,060
<i>Unraveling shadows</i>

12
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,362
<i>Stifling our breath,</i>

13
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,334
<i>Reaching for beyond,</i>

14
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,836
<i>Tearing through the dark</i>

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:10,304
<i>In fighting and in love</i>

16
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,909
<i>To the distant light above,</i>

17
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,548
<i>Yes, we are on the way</i>

18
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,589
<i>I wanna rock...</i>

19
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:27,687
<i>Rockin' my heart</i>

20
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,182
<i>It seems I've overused</i>
<i>my Sharingan...</i>

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,790
Are you alright, Sensei?

22
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,389
Not really... It will be hard just to
move for about a week...

23
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:50,826
Well...

24
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,594
It would be better if
you didn't move for a while.

25
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,899
O-Okay...

26
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:01,467
Hey! Sensei's awake.

27
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:03,337
Come on!

28
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:05,345
Your Sharingan is fantastic,

29
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,937
but if it puts that much of a strain
on your body, it may not be worth it!

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,410
S-Sorry...

31
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,246
But you know...

32
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:15,114
He did take down
a real powerful Ninja like that!

33
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,918
We probably don't need to
worry for a while.

34
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,552
Anyway, that kid with the mask...
What was he?

35
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,794
He was an ANBU black ops
from the Hidden Mist village.

36
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,965
It's a mask that the elite
Ninja Tracking Unit wears.

37
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:30,197
The elite Ninja Tracking Unit?

38
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:33,232
They're commonly called the
"fire extinguishing corps,"

39
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,774
and their duty is to erase all traces
that a Ninja ever lived.

40
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,103
The body of the Ninja reveals
a variety of things...

41
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:44,914
Ninjutsu secrets and Chakra characteristics
which permeate the Ninja of their village...

42
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:49,888
the composition of secret medicines
used on a Ninja's body...

43
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,488
For instance, if I were to die,

44
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,128
every secret about my Sharingan
would be investigated thoroughly,

45
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,561
and in the worst case,

46
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,727
there's a danger that
my entire Jutsu could be stolen.

47
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,170
In other words,
Tracker Ninja are specialists

48
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,265
that prevent village secrets
from leaking out

49
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,576
by killing Rogue Ninja
who've run away from their village,

50
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:16,014
and completely eliminating
their bodies.

51
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,816
First, I'll cut the mouth cloth
and have him spit up blood...

52
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:25,881
It's alright.

53
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,655
I'll do it... myself...

54
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:32,223
What?
You've already come back to life...

55
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:40,365
Darn, you really are rough...

56
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,302
You too, Zabuza.

57
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:47,243
Please don't pull them out
so violently or you really will die.

58
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:55,278
How long do you plan on keeping
that shady-looking mask on?!

59
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,285
Take it off!

60
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:02,552
It's a relic from the past,
and it's been handy for trickery...

61
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:11,168
But if I hadn't rescued you,
you certainly would have been killed.

62
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,639
If you were going to put me
into a state of apparent death,

63
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,540
you didn't need to aim for
the secret opening on my neck.

64
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:20,510
You're really a nasty one.

65
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:22,807
It couldn't be helped...

66
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:27,949
Besides, I didn't want to mark up
your immaculate body.

67
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:32,417
And also, I can aim more accurately
on the point on the neck

68
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,461
where there's not much muscle.

69
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,258
You'll be numb for about a week
and won't be able to move.

70
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,600
But since you're Zabuza,
perhaps you'll soon be able to move...

71
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:52,844
You're so innocent, smart,
and untainted...

72
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,909
That's what I like about you.

73
00:04:57,818 --> 00:05:00,150
I am, after all, still a child.

74
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:04,185
The fog has lifted.

75
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,116
Yes.

76
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,387
Will you be alright the next time?

77
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:11,492
The next time...

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,725
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.

79
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:21,063
<i>The Forest of Chakra</i>

80
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,106
<i>What is this?</i>

81
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,607
<i>Even though Zabuza is dead...</i>

82
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,782
<i>this indescribable uneasiness...</i>

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,115
<i>it must mean something</i>
<i>very important...</i>

84
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:35,220
<i>I have a feeling</i>
<i>I've overlooked something.</i>

85
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,683
What's going on?!
Sensei?

86
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:39,684
What?

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,354
Oh... so to continue my earlier story...

88
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:44,686
Ninja trackers...

89
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:48,257
take care of the bodies of people they've
killed, immediately and on the spot.

90
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,359
So what about that?

91
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,939
What did that kid with
the mask do with Zabuza?

92
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,344
How should we know?!

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,208
That masked one
took Zabuza away!

94
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,109
That's right...

95
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:09,479
If he needed proof he'd killed Zabuza,
he could simply have taken the head...

96
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:11,816
And the question is...

97
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:15,988
the weapon the Ninja tracker kid
used to kill Zabuza...

98
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:18,596
A regular Senbon...

99
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:20,699
That's impossible...

100
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,763
Right... it's impossible?!

101
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,800
What have you guys
been clamoring on and on about?!

102
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:32,739
It's probably that...
Zabuza is alive!

103
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:35,572
What?

104
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,217
What the heck do you mean?!

105
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,777
But Kakashi Sensei,
you made sure that he was dead!

106
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,118
It's true, I did make sure...

107
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:48,926
But, he was probably just in
a state of near-death.

108
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:58,469
The Senbon that Tracker Ninja used has
a very low ability to kill

109
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,803
unless it hits a vital spot...

110
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,302
It's something that was originally used
for medical treatments

111
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:05,845
such as acupuncture therapy.

112
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:10,350
Ninja trackers know all about
the structure of the human body...

113
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:15,110
putting people into a state of apparent
near death is probably simple for them.

114
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,553
First, he went to the trouble of
taking Zabuza's corpse

115
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,651
which was probably heavier
than he is.

116
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:27,265
Second, he used a Senbon,
a weapon with a low ability to kill.

117
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:30,164
From these two factors,

118
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:35,140
that youth wasn't aiming to
kill Zabuza but to save him.

119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,569
Aren't you reading
way too much into it?

120
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,738
No...

121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,276
If something seems fishy,
make preparations before it's too late.

122
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,616
That's also an iron clad rule
of the Shinobi!

123
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:57,553
<i>Humph... To hear that Zabuza</i>
<i>may be alive and to be pleased...</i>

124
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:01,193
Sensei, what do we do to make preparations
before it's too late?

125
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,459
You won't even be able
to move for a while...

126
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,165
I'll assign you training!

127
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:14,612
W-Wait a minute! Even with training,
we're not gonna be that strong!

128
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:19,681
Our opponent is a Ninja whom even you,
with the Sharingan, had a tough fight with!

129
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:22,551
Are you trying to kill us?!

130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,257
Sakura...

131
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,358
Who was it that saved me
during my difficult battle?

132
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:31,892
You've all quickly grown...
especially Naruto!

133
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,798
You've grown the most!

134
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,301
<i>He clearly does seem somewhat</i>
<i>stronger than before, but...</i>

135
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:48,876
So you noticed, Kakashi Sensei!
Now it's getting interesting!

136
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,941
It's not interesting at all...

137
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:58,146
Who the heck are you?

138
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,216
Hey, Inari!
Where've you been?!

139
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,990
Welcome back... Grandpa...

140
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,825
Inari, what sort of greeting is that?!

141
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,025
These are the Ninja
who escorted your grandpa!

142
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,969
It's okay, it's okay.
Right, Inari?

143
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,513
Mom, these guys will die...

144
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:23,749
There's no way they can
oppose Gato and win.

145
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,785
Say what, you little brat!

146
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,018
Now listen up!

147
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm a super hero who's gonna become
an awesome Ninja

148
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,052
named Hokage in the future!

149
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,559
I don't know if it's Gato or
Chocolat or whatever...

150
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:37,188
I'm not worried
about those guys, at all!

151
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:42,368
Huh, a hero. That's ridiculous!
There's no such thing!

152
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,728
W-What did you say?!

153
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,127
Stop that!

154
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,799
If you don't want to die,
you'd better hurry up and go home...

155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,311
Inari, where're you going?

156
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,185
The sea...
I'll be looking at the sea...

157
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,450
I apologize.

158
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:09,587
Shucks!

159
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:14,123
That brat... I need to tell him
a thing or two!

160
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,330
Huh?

161
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,233
<i>Is he crying?!</i>

162
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,988
D-Dad...

163
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,331
So, now the training begins!

164
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:53,196
Yes, sir!

165
00:10:53,874 --> 00:11:00,609
So... before that, let me again explain
Chakra power for a Ninja, from the basics.

166
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:01,812
At this point...

167
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:06,013
Of course we know about that!
Chatora, right?

168
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:07,743
It's Chakra...

169
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:10,451
Yes, Sakura...?

170
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,124
Are you listening, Naruto?!

171
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,689
It's tiresome, so I'll explain it simply!

172
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:22,131
Chakra is energy that
a Ninja needs when he uses a Jutsu!

173
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,599
It's made up of two energies:

174
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:29,234
1) Physical energy gathered together
from each and every cell in the body and

175
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:35,912
2) Spiritual energy accumulated based
on numerous trainings and experiences!

176
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:41,045
In other words, Jutsu wrings out and
combines these two energies

177
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,418
from within the body,

178
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,617
and this is called
"combining the Chakra."

179
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:51,092
Then Chakra is activated
by forming hand "signs."

180
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,258
That's exactly right!

181
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,867
Iruka Sensei really does
have good students.

182
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,432
Whatever! I may not understand
difficult explanations,

183
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:04,476
but I'll just learn it with my body!

184
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:06,211
Naruto is absolutely right...

185
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,409
We're already able to use Jutsu...

186
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,679
No! All of you still haven't used
Chakra efficiently.

187
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:14,782
What?!

188
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,187
Hold on and listen...

189
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,488
As Sakura explained earlier,

190
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,597
combining Chakra means picking up
both the physical and spiritual energies

191
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:26,530
and mixing them together
within the body.

192
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:33,398
And of course the amount of each energy,
the preparation of the energy,

193
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,999
changes based on
the Jutsu you want to activate...

194
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:39,840
All of you at present aren't
using Chakra efficiently!

195
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,175
Even if you're able to combine
a lot of Chakra,

196
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:47,118
if you're not able to control it
in a balanced way

197
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,486
the effectiveness of the Jutsu
not only will be cut in half

198
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,892
but it may not even
be activated at all.

199
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,157
Wasting energy will prevent you from
battling for long periods.

200
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:59,756
These are some of
the weaknesses that can occur.

201
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,562
W-What should we do...?

202
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,602
You need to learn to control
the Chakra with your body!

203
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:11,403
It's difficult training that requires you
to put your life on the line to master!

204
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,013
W-What will we do?

205
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,048
Hm?

206
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:18,744
Tree climbing...

207
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,551
Tree climbing?!

208
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:21,718
That's right.

209
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,082
But it's not just simple tree-climbing!

210
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,421
You will climb
without using your hands.

211
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,284
What? How?

212
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,422
Well! Just watch.

213
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:49,675
He's climbing...

214
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,978
Perpendicular to the tree
and with his feet!

215
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,248
So see, kind of like this...

216
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,521
Focus the Chakra on the bottoms of your feet
and make them stick to the tree trunk.

217
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,993
If you use Chakra well,
you can do things like this.

218
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,255
Wait a minute!

219
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,226
How does something like that
make you strong?

220
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,696
So this is the main point...

221
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,366
The aim of this training is
to accumulate

222
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:19,071
the required amount of combined Chakra
to the required spot...

223
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,974
This is surprisingly difficult
even for an expert Ninja.

224
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,877
The amount of Chakra used
for tree climbing is very subtle.

225
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:32,923
And the bottoms of the feet are
the most difficult place to gather Chakra.

226
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:37,058
Anyway! In other words,
if you master that control

227
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:42,534
it will be possible to master
any Jutsu. In theory, that is!

228
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,035
The second aim is to maintain
that combined Chakra.

229
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,003
Ninja combine the most Chakra
during battles.

230
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,177
Under such situations,

231
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,910
"control" and "maintenance"
of Chakra becomes most difficult.

232
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:02,183
So anyway, nothing's really gonna
happen with me saying this and that...

233
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:06,090
You'll need to learn it with your bodies

234
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,430
Use that Kunai to put a mark
at the spot

235
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,229
where you can climb up to
under your own strength now.

236
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,034
Next make an effort to
put a mark further from it.

237
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,374
You aren't good enough to
walk up from the start,

238
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:30,507
so run and use your momentum
to get used to it... You got it?!

239
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:36,780
This training is nothing!
Hah, it's too easy for me!

240
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,989
After all, I'm the man
who's grown the most!

241
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:44,923
Enough with the talk...
Now get to it. Try climbing any tree.

242
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:50,828
<i>OK, so first I need to gather</i>
<i>the Chakra on the bottoms of my feet...</i>

243
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:03,244
Ready!! Here I go!

244
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,857
<i>I didn't think it'd be this difficult to</i>
<i>maintain a constant amount of Chakra...</i>

245
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,161
<i>If the Chakra is too strong</i>
<i>you get pushed back...</i>

246
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:31,877
<i>But if the Chakra is too weak,</i>
<i>there's no sticking power and that happens.</i>

247
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:35,071
Well...!

248
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:37,773
The difference between Naruto and Sasuke
seems about right.

249
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,550
This is pretty easy!

250
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:40,953
What?!

251
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,722
S-Sakura!

252
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:54,063
So, it looks like the one with the best control
of the Chakra is Sakura, the girl...

253
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:00,036
Wow! Way to go, Sakura!

254
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,234
Just what you'd expect from
the girl I set my sights on!

255
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,204
<i>But it does sort of tick me off!</i>

256
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:05,567
Whatever!

257
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,540
<i>I wanted Sasuke to notice me...</i>

258
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,043
<i>Why does this always happen?!</i>

259
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,147
Well, not only does Sakura have
knowledge about Chakra,

260
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:17,346
her control and stamina
are pretty good.

261
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,917
It looks like...

262
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:24,597
She might be the closest one to
becoming a Hokage... unlike someone else.

263
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:29,092
And also, the Uchiha Clan
isn't really that great...

264
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,198
Shut up Sensei!

265
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,203
<i>Sasuke won't like me then!</i>

266
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:40,811
<i>Having said that... Naruto and Sasuke...</i>

267
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:44,282
<i>Those two have an incredible amount</i>
<i>of Chakra hidden in them...</i>

268
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,477
<i>that Sakura can't even match!</i>

269
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:50,280
<i>If this training goes well,</i>
<i>this will become an asset to them...</i>

270
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,919
OK! First I'll catch up to Sasuke!

271
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,455
I'll do it... for sure!

272
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>Whatever!</i>

273
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,500
<i>Even if they do that,</i>
<i>it's just a waste...</i>

274
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,289
Unbelievable...

275
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,454
Even you got beaten and
had to come back?

276
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,259
The Ninja from the Hidden Mist Village
look like total weaklings!

277
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,636
You can't even clean up after
your subordinates,

278
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,933
and you think you're a "demon"!
Don't make me laugh!

279
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,738
<i>So they're drawing swords...</i>

280
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,143
Hold on. Wait.

281
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:54,844
Hey... There's no need to stay silent!

282
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,121
Why don't you say something?

283
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,761
Don't touch Zabuza
with your dirty hands!

284
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,256
I-It's gonna break...!

285
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,130
<i>N-No way...</i>

286
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,467
<i>He moved...in an instant...</i>

287
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,069
I wouldn't do that...
I'm ticked off!!

288
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:25,409
Next time...

289
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:27,883
If you lose again next time...

290
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:30,445
remember that there'll be
no place for you here!

291
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:32,921
I'm leaving!

292
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,165
Haku... Such unnecessary actions...

293
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:41,956
I know...

294
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:47,098
But it's too early to take down
Gato right now...

295
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,504
If we make trouble here...

296
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,047
We'll be pursued by them again.

297
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,615
We must restrain ourselves for now.

298
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:00,649
Yeah...

299
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,447
You're right.

300
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,587
Ohhhhh...

301
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,127
Ou-ch!!

302
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,075
<i>I'm totally worn out!</i>

303
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,605
<i>How much stamina</i>
<i>can those two have?</i>

304
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,580
<i>But Naruto isn't getting</i>
<i>any better at all.</i>

305
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:39,757
<i>He'll soon give up and</i>
<i>start throwing a tantrum.</i>

306
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:42,752
Shoot!

307
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,430
<i>See! He sure is</i>
<i>an easy one to figure out!</i>

308
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,401
Hey, Sakura!

309
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:51,666
Can you give me some tips?

310
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:52,502
What?

311
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,441
Let's keep it a secret from Sasuke!
Come on, come on.

312
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:03,173
He's getting stronger and stronger...
How strong will he get?

313
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,109
At any rate Naruto...

314
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:09,917
the amount of your dormant Chakra
is probably more than Sasuke's.

315
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,357
And it's even more than mine!

316
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,758
I look forward to it... I really do.

317
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:58,391
That Inari...
He was crying all by himself.

318
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,935
He was looking at the sea
and crying the entire time.

319
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,439
He's always crying all alone.

320
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,532
What's that gonna do?

321
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,872
What happened
that made him so sad?!

322
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,977
