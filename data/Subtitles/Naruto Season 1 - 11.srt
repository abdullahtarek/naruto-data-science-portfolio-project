1
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:10,758
<i>C'mon!</i>

2
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,730
<i>Running like a fugitive,</i>

3
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,933
<i>Being chased by something</i>

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,272
<i>Inside my heart is pounding</i>

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,008
<i>My throat dry like it's withering</i>

6
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:35,812
<i>For no single one,</i>

7
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:39,587
<i>To none does belong,</i>

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,326
<i>This time is ours, right now...</i>

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,832
<i>Unraveling the pain,</i>

10
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:51,664
<i>Unraveling our hearts,</i>

11
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:54,069
<i>Unraveling shadows</i>

12
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,371
<i>Stifling our breath,</i>

13
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,343
<i>Reaching for beyond,</i>

14
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,845
<i>Tearing through the dark</i>

15
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:10,313
<i>In fighting and in love</i>

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,918
<i>To the distant light above,</i>

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,557
<i>Yes, we are on the way</i>

18
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,598
<i>I wanna rock...</i>

19
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,695
<i>Rockin' my heart</i>

20
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,523
It looks like you've got some time
to kill there all by yourself.

21
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,732
What happened to the blond boy
and that stuck up boy?

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,892
They're in the middle of
the tree-climbing training.

23
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,630
You don't have to do that?

24
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,297
I'm exceptional, so Kakashi Sensei
told me to guard you.

25
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,404
Really?

26
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,843
What?!

27
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,439
You got a minute, Tazuna?

28
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,209
Huh? What's up, Giichi?

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,478
Uh, actually...

30
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,023
I gave it a lot of thought.

31
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,087
Building this bridge...
will you let me quit?

32
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:33,328
Why so suddenly? Not you too?!

33
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,427
Tazuna, I've had a bond
with you from the old days.

34
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,201
I'd like to cooperate,
but if we push it too far,

35
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,673
Gato will set his sights
on us, too.

36
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:49,014
Also... if you get killed,
everything is lost!

37
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,948
Why don't you just
stop building the bridge?

38
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,416
Not a chance...

39
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,388
This is our bridge.

40
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,068
This is the bridge that
everyone in town has built

41
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:12,296
believing that it would generate
distribution and transportation

42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,636
for this poor Land of Waves
that has few resources.

43
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,707
But if it goes so far as
to take our lives...

44
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,908
It's already afternoon...

45
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:21,813
Let's call it a day.

46
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:24,642
Tazuna!

47
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,586
Giichi... you don't have to
come back tomorrow.

48
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:41,365
<i>The Land Where a Hero Once Lived</i>

49
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,736
Damn it!

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,308
What the heck is up with this?

51
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,126
<i>I won't lose to you!</i>

52
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:26,308
Say, where are we going?

53
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,980
I was asked to get some ingredients
for dinner on the way home...

54
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:32,516
WILL DO ANY KIND OF WORK

55
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,851
Thief!

56
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,752
<i>What's up with... this town?</i>

57
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,288
We're here...

58
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,333
Welcome...

59
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,938
<i>There's hardly anything here...</i>

60
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,951
You pervert!!

61
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,084
You're... wrong...

62
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,524
Man, I was really surprised earlier.

63
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,694
What's going on with this town?!

64
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:23,494
<i>Again?</i>

65
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,262
Hey, you...

66
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:29,831
What?

67
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,309
Gimme some!

68
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,817
Oh... Here...

69
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:47,924
Yaaay!

70
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:50,720
Thank you.

71
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,270
This is how it's been ever
since Gato showed up.

72
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:02,371
Here, all the adults
have turned into cowards.

73
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:12,043
So that's why now
that bridge is necessary...

74
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,419
It's a symbol of bravery...

75
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,114
in order to restore their spirit,
so they don't keep running away...

76
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,681
For the people of this land...

77
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,693
who have set their minds
on remaining passive...

78
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:29,464
If we can just...
complete that bridge...

79
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,262
this town will return to
how it once was...

80
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,340
and everyone will come back.

81
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,845
<i>Sasuke... Naruto...</i>

82
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,700
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>

83
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,407
<i>Are you telling me that</i>
<i>Sasuke's still climbing?!</i>

84
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:15,872
<i>Darn it...</i>

85
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,809
<i>He's gradually catching up...</i>

86
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,583
<i>Darn it! No! No!</i>

87
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:28,193
<i>If I let myself get distracted by Sasuke,</i>
<i>my concentration will be disturbed!</i>

88
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,093
Hey Sakura,
can you give me some tips?

89
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:35,032
Huh?

90
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,996
Without telling Sasuke, okay, okay?

91
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:40,466
Listen.

92
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:45,805
Chakra uses spiritual energy,
so you mustn't get too strained or frantic.

93
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,475
Relax and concentrate on the tree
so that you can constantly accumulate

94
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,779
a fixed amount of Chakra
in the bottom of your feet.

95
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,346
<i>Concentrate!</i>
<i>Concentrate!</i>

96
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,179
<i>Okay. I'm getting good vibes, I say!</i>

97
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,257
<i>Okay! This is it!</i>

98
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,187
Hey... Naruto!

99
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:05,424
Jeez, what the heck's
wrong with you?!

100
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,665
Don't interfere while
I'm trying to concentrate!

101
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,232
U... Uh... Well...

102
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,729
W-What is it?!

103
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:18,343
<i>I'm not used to</i>
<i>him speaking to me first...</i>

104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,239
Y-You asked Sakura to give
you some tips before...

105
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,579
What did she say to you?

106
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,623
I'm not telling!

107
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,541
Man...

108
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,134
This is really fun!

109
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,442
It's been a long time since we've had
a meal with this many people!

110
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,019
Seconds please!

111
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,189
Stop eating if you're going to vomit!

112
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,164
No, I'll eat.

113
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,933
I have to eat even
if it means enduring.

114
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,826
I have to get strong
as quickly as possible, so...

115
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,606
Yes yes!

116
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,606
But vomiting is different.

117
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:34,119
Excuse me, why is there
a torn picture hanging here?

118
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,921
Inari was looking at this
all through dinner.

119
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,187
This torn part looks like someone who was
in the picture was deliberately torn off.

120
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:49,399
It's my husband...

121
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,663
He's a man who was
once called a hero of this town...

122
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,003
Inari! Where are you going?

123
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,182
Dad!

124
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,354
I'm always telling you not to
talk about that person in front of Inari!

125
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,363
What're you saying happened with Inari?

126
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,169
It appears there's
some kind of good reason.

127
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,277
Inari had a father
not related by blood...

128
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:38,777
It was like they were a real father
and son who got along really well...

129
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:45,216
Back then, Inari was a child
who laughed all the time...

130
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:48,122
However...

131
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,025
However...

132
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:03,203
Inari has changed...
ever since that incident with his father.

133
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,406
The word bravery was eternally taken

134
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:14,853
from the people of this island
and from Inari...

135
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,189
With that day,
that incident, as the trigger.

136
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:22,295
That incident?
What happened to Inari?

137
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:26,531
To explain the incident,
I must first...

138
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:31,704
tell you about the man
who was called the hero of this land.

139
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,204
Hero?

140
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,075
It was around three years ago...

141
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:39,212
when Inari met the man...

142
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:42,912
Potchi!!

143
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,913
Potchi!!

144
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,315
Wrong!

145
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,882
His name's Shooting Star...

146
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,882
As of today, he's my dog!

147
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,458
He's not Shooting Star!
He's my Potchi! Give him back!

148
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,420
Potchi's my friend!

149
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,893
Who's going to give him
to the likes of you?!

150
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:02,800
Shut up!

151
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,404
Potchi!!

152
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,612
That's cuz you wouldn't
hand him over quietly...

153
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:19,176
Now I couldn't care less
about that dog!

154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,519
Hey, let him go!

155
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:26,320
What have you done?!
Are you trying to kill Potchi?!

156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,929
Heh! He's your special mutt, right?

157
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,993
Then save him, quick.

158
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,634
What's the matter?

159
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,862
Is it okay with you if he dies?!

160
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:46,806
<i>Of course I'm not okay</i>
<i>with him dying!</i>

161
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,675
<i>He's my only friend!</i>

162
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,448
- <i>But...</i>
- Look. He can't even dog paddle

163
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,749
- even though he's a dog!
- <i>But...</i>

164
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,955
<i>I'm sorry, Potchi...</i>
<i>I can't swim...</i>

165
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:03,087
Hey! If you're his owner,
dive in after him!

166
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,138
This is bad, Akane.
What if he can't swim?

167
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,308
S-Save me!

168
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:18,570
Leave him be.

169
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:20,172
B-But...

170
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,942
Then why don't <i>you</i> go
save him if you like?

171
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,084
<i>I-I don't want to die...</i>
<i>Somebody save me!</i>

172
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,191
P-Potchi!

173
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,786
Potchi!

174
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:38,888
I'm gonna digress, but...

175
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,498
Potchi learned
how to dog paddle then.

176
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:47,338
Potchi!

177
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,549
Shooting Star escaped. Get him!

178
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:12,188
<i>Ohhh... I can't breathe...</i>
<i>This... is it...</i>

179
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,031
Are you awake, boy?

180
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,607
I gave those kids
a good scolding.

181
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,476
Here, eat!

182
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,180
<i>Is this God? Oh...</i>

183
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,815
Did you... save me?

184
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,685
Just eat! Start with that.

185
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:46,458
I see. You were betrayed
by your dog, too...

186
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:51,102
In my country, dogs are creatures
that have a keen sense of loyalty...

187
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:54,673
Well, you betrayed
your dog's trust first,

188
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,208
so there's nothing
you can do about that.

189
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,607
I was scared and couldn't move.

190
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,978
I wanted to save him...

191
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:08,114
But... I have no guts, so...

192
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:09,547
That's right.

193
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,884
Of course a kid your age
would be scared.

194
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,688
But you know... boy.

195
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,125
Just remember this.

196
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,098
Huh?

197
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,966
If you're a man choose
a lifestyle you won't regret...

198
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,835
For things I truly
hold dear to myself,

199
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:32,307
I'll protect them until the very end
with both these arms.

200
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,572
Even if it's tough, or sad,
I'll stick it out...

201
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:38,277
even if it looks like
I might lose my life!

202
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,347
His name was Kaiza and

203
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:49,128
he was a fisherman who'd come to this land
from another country in search of his dreams.

204
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:53,191
After that, Inari really took to Kaiza.

205
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,762
It may have been because Inari
had lost his real father

206
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,771
when he was too young
to remember anything.

207
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:02,132
But he was very attached to Kaiza.

208
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,608
They were like father and son...

209
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:08,276
It didn't take long
for Kaiza to become...

210
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,717
a member of the family.

211
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:16,687
And he was a man
this town needed.

212
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,456
We... we've got trouble, Kaiza!

213
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,855
The river dam has broken
from this rain!

214
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,528
At this rate,
District D will be consumed!

215
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:25,524
What?!

216
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:26,389
Dad!

217
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
Inari, go out back and
get some rope!

218
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:29,167
Okay!

219
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:30,728
Its no good!

220
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,835
The only thing we can do is
to attach a rope and pull...

221
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,867
Don't talk nonsense!
How are we going to attach a rope?!

222
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,974
We'd die if we were to go
into such a furious current!

223
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:42,010
But if we drag our feet,
District D will be annihilated!

224
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,440
What should we do?

225
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:44,643
I'll do it.

226
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,080
Kaiza!

227
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:49,748
Don't be foolish!

228
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,752
Even you wouldn't be able to!

229
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,218
Dad!

230
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,054
Don't worry...

231
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:57,261
Your dad's unmatched.

232
00:16:57,864 --> 00:17:01,595
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so...

233
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,435
<i>For things I truly hold dear to myself...</i>

234
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,210
<i>Even if I lose my life...</i>

235
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:25,357
<i>I'll protect them to the end...</i>
<i>with both these arms!</i>

236
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,859
Dad, hang in there!

237
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,463
He did it!
The rope... the rope's attached!

238
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,440
Okay, everybody pull!

239
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,533
Yeah!

240
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:48,744
From then on... the people of this land
called Kaiza a hero.

241
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:53,115
And he became a father
that Inari could be proud of.

242
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,181
It was around that time when Gato
set his sights on this land.

243
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,119
And then, one night...

244
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,502
I heard...

245
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,712
That you're going to protect
this town with those arms...

246
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,346
I dare you to!

247
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:01,120
Listen up!

248
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:05,857
This man resisted through force,
the policies of the Gato corporation

249
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,053
and disturbed the order
of this nation.

250
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:11,323
Therefore, he will now be executed!

251
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:22,204
I just hope that such trivial matters
will never occur again.

252
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,234
Dad!

253
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,171
Stop, Inari...

254
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:34,047
Do it...

255
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:39,085
Dad...

256
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,922
Dad!

257
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,798
Didn't you tell me?

258
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,806
That you'd... protect...

259
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:12,416
me and the people of this land...
with both your arms?

260
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,023
Dad, you liar...

261
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,431
Ever since then,
Inari has changed...

262
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,705
as well as Tsunami...
and the townspeople...

263
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:35,280
Hero, that's just stupid.
There's no such thing!

264
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,029
What're you doing, Naruto?

265
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:58,893
You've had enough training for today.
You've built up too much Chakra.

266
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,963
You'll die if you move
any more than that.

267
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,672
I'll prove it.

268
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,342
Prove what?

269
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,071
I'll prove that...

270
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,448
there <i>are</i> heroes...

271
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,217
in this world!

272
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,599
Huh? What do you want, lady?

273
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,431
As for me, I'm training right now.

274
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,602
Cuz we don't know when
Zabuza will strike next...

275
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,473
Getting strong for someone special
is something I understand very well.

276
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,275
So I'm going to get
stronger and stronger.

277
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,012
I'll show Inari that there are heroes
in this world.

278
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,655
Next time:
"Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!"

279
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,320
As for me, I'm going to
kick butt once again!
