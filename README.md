## Overview
In this project, we have created four folders, each containing the code for a different part of the project:
      
**crawler**: This folder contains the code for web scraping the internet to build a comprehensive dataset about the anime using Scrapy.

**character_network**: This folder contains the code for creating an intricate character network using Spacy's NER model, NetworkX, and PyViz.

**jutsu_classifier**: This folder contains the code for training a text classifier that can identify different Jutsu types based on their titles and descriptions.

**theme_classifier**: This folder contains the code for extracting the main themes of Naruto using Zero-shot classifiers.

## Requirements
Before running the code in this project, make sure you have installed the following packages:

* Scrapy
* Spacy
* NetworkX
* PyViz
* nltk
* Transformers      
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* numpy


You can install these packages using pip or conda.

## Usage
To use this project, simply clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the folder for the part of the project that you are interested in. Each folder contains its own README file with instructions on how to run the code.

So, fellow shinobi, grab your ninja headband and unleash your inner Hokage by exploring the world of Naruto anime through data science!
